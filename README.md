# Intelligent Sampling
Intelligent Sampling is a novel technique for improving sample quality in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. 


We provide a method, based on the Bayes Theorem to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific incoming workload and our heterogeneous infrastructure model.


We leverage the [Alibaba PAI dataset](https://github.com/alibaba/clusterdata/tree/master/cluster-trace-gpu-v2020) to show that our approach is 2.5x times more accurate compared with other state-of-the-art sampling mechanisms while retaining comparable performance and scalability.
